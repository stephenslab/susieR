```{r setup}

## Data
```{r}
setwd("~/Desktop/M/single_cell_project/data")
b.data = readMM('b_filtered/hg19/matrix.mtx')
cd34.data = readMM('cd34_filtered/hg19/matrix.mtx')
jurkat.data = readMM('jurkat_filtered/hg19/matrix.mtx')
monocytes.data = readMM('monocytes_filtered/hg19/matrix.mtx')
regulatory.t.data = readMM('regulatory_t_filtered/hg19/matrix.mtx')
```

## Sample X and set a binary y
```{r}
set.seed(1)
# First X1: consider B cells and monocytes cells classification problem
b.cells = b.data[,sample(ncol(b.data),1000)]
monocytes.cells = monocytes.data[,sample(ncol(monocytes.data),1000)]
# Second X2: consider B cells and T cells classification problem
regulatory.t.cells = regulatory.t.data[,sample(ncol(regulatory.t.data),1000)]

# X1.raw is a n=2000 by p=32738 matrix
# X1 is a n=2000 by p=14125 matrix after removing columns with all zeros
X1.raw = t(cbind(b.cells,monocytes.cells))
keepX1 = which(colSums(X1.raw)!=0)
X1 = X1.raw[,keepX1]
# X2.raw is a n=2000 by p=32738 matrix
# X2 is also a n=2000 by p=14125 matrix after removing columns with all zeros
X2.raw = t(cbind(b.cells,regulatory.t.cells))
keepX2 = which(colSums(X2.raw)!=0)
X2 = X2.raw[,keepX1]
# y.binary is a 2000-vector
y.binary = c(rep(1,1000), rep(0, 1000))
```

## X1: run glmnet 
```{r}
X1.fit.glmnet = cv.glmnet(X1, y.binary, family = "binomial") # Perform logistic regression in glmnet
```

```{r}
plot(X1.fit.glmnet)
X1.coef.glmnet = coef(X1.fit.glmnet, s = "lambda.min")
length(which(X1.coef.glmnet!=0)-1)
```

## X1: run susieR

I run approximately 40 mins for this susie L=50.
```{r}
# Consider susie using L=50, suggested by glmnet 47
X1.susie = susie(as.matrix(X1), y.binary, L=50)
```

susie shows that we only need 13 features to distinguish B cells and monocytes cells (also have some overlappings). Compared to glmnet, we need 48 features to seperate B cells from monocytes cells. 

```{r}
X1.susie.CS = susie_get_CS(X1.susie)
X1.susie.CS.size = c()
for (i in 1:50){
  X1.susie.CS.size = c(X1.susie.CS.size,length(X1.susie.CS[[1]][[i]]))
}
for (j in 1:15){
  print(X1.susie.CS[[1]][[j]])
}
X1.susie.CS.size
```

## X2: run glmnet

glmnet shows that we need 23 features to distinguish B cells from regulatory-T cells.
```{r}
X2.fit.glmnet = cv.glmnet(X2, y.binary, family = "binomial") # Perform logistic regression in glmnet
```

```{r}
plot(X2.fit.glmnet)
X2.coef.glmnet = coef(X2.fit.glmnet, s = "lambda.min")
length(which(X2.coef.glmnet!=0)-1)
```

```{r}
which(X2.coef.glmnet!=0)-1
```
## X2: run susieR
```{r}
# Consider susie using L=30, suggested by glmnet 24
X2.susie = susie(as.matrix(X2), y.binary, L=30)
```

susie shows that we only need 8 features to distinguish B cells from
regulatory-T cells (also have 2 overlappings). Compared to glmnet, we
need 24 features to seperate B cells from regulatory-T cells.

```{r}
X2.susie.CS = susie_get_CS(X2.susie)
X2.susie.CS.size = c()
for (i in 1:30){
  X2.susie.CS.size = c(X2.susie.CS.size,length(X2.susie.CS[[1]][[i]]))
}
for (j in 1:9){
  print(X2.susie.CS[[1]][[j]])
}
X2.susie.CS.size
```
