This vignettes demonstrates `susieR` in the context of genetic fine-mapping. 
We use simulated data of expression level of a gene ($y$) in $N \approx 600$ individuals. 
We want to identify with the genotype matrix $X_{N\times P}$ ($P=1000$) the genetic variables that causes changes in expression level.

The simulated data-set is [available here](https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR/blob/master/inst/data/N3finemapping.rds), as part of the `susieR` package. It is simulated to have exactly 3 non-zero effects.

```{r}
library(susieR)
set.seed(1)
```

## The data-set

```{r}
dat = readRDS(system.file("data", "N3finemapping.rds", package = "susieR"))
names(dat)
```

`data` contains regression data-set $X$ and $y$, along with some other relevant properties in the context of genetic studies. It also contains the "true" regression coefficent the data is simulated from.

```{r}
names(dat$data)
```

Notice that we've simulated 2 sets of $Y$ as 2 simulation replicates. Here we'll focus on the first data-set.

```{r}
dim(dat$data$Y)
```

Here are the 3 "true" signals in the first data-set:

```{r}
b = dat$data$true_coef[,1]
plot(b, pch=16, ylab='effect size')
```

```{r}
which(b != 0)
```

So the underlying causal variables are 403, 653 and 773.

## Simple regression summary statistics

The data-set additionally provides summary statistics for fitting univariate simple regression variable by variable. The results are $\hat{\beta}$ and $SE(\hat{\beta})$ from which z-scores can be derived. Again we focus only on results from the first data-set:

```{r}
z_scores = dat$sumstats[1,,] / dat$sumstats[2,,]
z_scores = z_scores[,1]
susie_pplot(z_scores, dtype='z', b=b)
```

## Fine-mapping with `susieR`

For starters, we assume there are at most 5 causal variables, i.e., set `L=5`, although SuSiE is robust to the choice of `L`. 

We set SuSiE prior variance to 0.1, and update residual variance in the variational algorithm that fits SuSiE model. The `susieR` function call is:

```{r}
fitted = susie(dat$data$X, dat$data$Y[,1],
               L=5,
               estimate_residual_variance = TRUE, 
               prior_variance = 0.1, 
               tol=1e-3)
```

### Confidence sets

We obtain 95% confidence set by:

```{r}
sets = susie_get_CS(fitted,
                    coverage = 0.95,
                    X= dat$data$X, 
                    min_abs_corr = 0.1)
```

Notice that by passing to `susie_get_CS` function the data matrix `X`, we further filter the sets identified by removing those having absolute correlation between any pairs of variables in the set smaller than specified value, which is 0.1 in the function call above. We call this a "purity" filter.

```{r}
print(sets)
```

The 3 causal signals have been captured by the 3 CS reported here. The 3rd CS contains many variables, including the true causal variable `403`. The minimum absolute correlation is 0.86. 

If we use the default 90% coverage for confidence sets, we still capture the 3 signals, but "purity" of the 3rd CS is now 0.91 and size of the CS is also a bit smaller.

```{r}
sets = susie_get_CS(fitted,
                    X= dat$data$X, 
                    min_abs_corr = 0.1)
```

```{r}
print(sets)
```

### Posterior inclusion probability

Previously we've determined that summing over 3 single effect regression models is approperate for our application. Here we summarize the variable selection results by computing posterior inclusion probability for SuSiE model:

```{r}
pip = susie_get_PIP(fitted, sets$cs_index)
```

```{r}
susie_pplot(pip, fitted=fitted, dtype='PIP', b=b)
```

The true causal variables are colored red. The CS identified are circled in different colors. Of interest is the cluster around position 400. The true signal is 403 but apparently it does not have the highest PIP. To compare ranking of PIP and original z-score in that CS:

```{r}
z3 = cbind(sets$cs[[3]], z_scores[sets$cs[[3]]], pip[sets$cs[[3]]])
colnames(z3) = c('position', 'z-score', 'PIP')
z3[order(z3[,2], decreasing = TRUE),]
```

### Choice of priors

We found that SuSiE is generally robust to choice of priors. Here we set prior variance to 0.2, and compare with previous results:

```{r}
fitted = susie(dat$data$X, dat$data$Y[,1],
               L=5,
               estimate_residual_variance = TRUE, 
               prior_variance = 0.2, 
               tol=1e-3)
sets = susie_get_CS(fitted,
                    X= dat$data$X, 
                    min_abs_corr = 0.1)
pip = susie_get_PIP(fitted, sets$cs_index)
susie_pplot(pip, fitted=fitted, dtype='PIP', b=b)
```

which largely remains unchanged. It is also possible to use `estimate_prior_variance = TRUE` to estimate prior variance estimates in variational updates.
(FIXME: need to comment on whether this is recommanded.)
