```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This fits a sparse linear regression model with up to $L$ non-zero effects.
Generally there is no harm in over-stating $L$ (that is, the method
is pretty robust to overfitting) except that computation will grow as $L$ grows.

Here is a minimal example:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
n = 1000
p = 1000
beta = rep(0,p)
beta[1] = 1
beta[2] = 1
beta[300] = 1
beta[400] = 1
X = matrix(rnorm(n*p),nrow=n,ncol=p)
y = X %*% beta + rnorm(n)
res = susieR::susie(X,y,L=10)
plot(coef(res))
plot(y,predict(res))
```
