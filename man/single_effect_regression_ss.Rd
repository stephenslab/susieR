\usage{
single_effect_regression_ss(XtY, dXtX, sa2 = 1, s2 = 1,
  optimize_sa2 = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{XtY}{an p vector}

\item{dXtX}{an p vector, diagonal elements of t(X)X}

\item{sa2}{the scaled prior variance (so prior variance is sa2*s2)}

\item{s2}{the residual variance}
}
\value{
a list with elements: \cr
\item{alpha}{vector of posterior inclusion probabilities. ie alpha[i] is posterior probability that
 that b[i] is non-zero}
\item{mu}{vector of posterior means (conditional on inclusion)}
\item{mu2}{vector of posterior second moments (conditional on inclusion)}
\item{bf}{vector of Bayes factors for each variable}
}
\description{
Bayesian single-effect linear regression of Y on X
}
\details{
Performs single-effect linear regression of Y on X. That is, this function
fits the regression model Y= Xb + e, where elements of e are iid N(0,s2) and the
b is a p vector of effects to be estimated.
The assumption is that b has exactly one non-zero element, with all elements
equally likely to be non-zero. The prior on the non-zero element is N(0,var=sa2*s2).
Only the summary statistcs t(X)Y and diagonal elements of t(X)X are avialable.
