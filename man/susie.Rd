\title{Bayesian sum of single-effect (susie) linear regression of Y on X}
\usage{
susie(X, Y, L = 10, prior_variance = 0.2, residual_variance = NULL,
  standardize = TRUE, intercept = TRUE, max_iter = 100, tol = 0.01,
  estimate_residual_variance = TRUE, estimate_prior_variance = FALSE,
  s_init = NULL, verbose = FALSE, track_fit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{an n by p matrix of covariates}

\item{Y}{an n vector}

\item{L}{maximum number of non-zero effects}

\item{prior_variance}{the scaled prior variance (vector of length L, or scalar. In latter case gets repeated L times )}

\item{residual_variance}{the residual variance (defaults to variance of Y)}

\item{standardize}{logical flag for whether to standardize columns of X to unit variance prior to fitting.
Note that `prior_variance` specifies the prior on the coefficients of X after standardization (if performed).
If you do not standardize you may need
to think carefully about specifying
`prior_variance`. Whatever the value of standardize, the coefficients (returned from `coef`) are for X on the original input scale.
Any column of X that has zero variance is not standardized, but left as is.}

\item{intercept}{Should intercept be fitted (default=TRUE) or set to zero (FALSE)}

\item{max_iter}{maximum number of iterations to perform}

\item{tol}{convergence tolerance}

\item{estimate_residual_variance}{indicates whether to estimate residual variance}

\item{estimate_prior_variance}{indicates whether to estimate prior (currently not recommended as not working as well)}

\item{s_init}{a previous susie fit with which to initialize}

\item{verbose}{if true outputs some progress messages}

\item{track_fit}{add an attribute \code{trace} to output that saves current values of all iterations}
}
\value{
a susie fit, which is a list with some or all of the following elements\cr
\item{alpha}{an L by p matrix of posterior inclusion probabilites}
\item{mu}{an L by p matrix of posterior means (conditional on inclusion)}
\item{mu2}{an L by p matrix of posterior second moments (conditional on inclusion)}
\item{Xr}{an n vector of fitted values, equal to X times colSums(alpha*mu))}
\item{sigma2}{residual variance}
\item{sa2}{scaled prior variance; ie prior variance is sigma2*sa2}
\item{elbo}{vector of values of elbo achieved (objective function)}
}
\details{
Performs sum of single-effect (susie) linear regression of Y on X.
That is, this function
fits the regression model Y= sum_l Xb_l + e, where elements of e are iid N(0,s2) and the
sum_l b_l is a p vector of effects to be estimated.
The assumption is that each b_l has exactly one non-zero element, with all elements
equally likely to be non-zero. The prior on the non-zero element is N(0,var=sa2*s2).
