\title{An attempt to automate reliable running of susie even on hard problems}
\usage{
susie_auto(X, Y, L_init = 1, L_max = 512, verbose = FALSE, init_tol = 1,
  standardize = TRUE, intercept = TRUE, max_iter = 100, tol = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{an n by p matrix of covariates}

\item{Y}{an n vector}

\item{L_init}{the initial value of L to consider}

\item{verbose}{if true outputs some progress messages}

\item{init_tol}{the tolerance to pass to susie during early runs (set big to run faster)}

\item{standardize}{logical flag for whether to standardize columns of X to unit variance prior to fitting.
Note that `prior_variance` specifies the prior on the coefficients of X after standardization (if performed).
If you do not standardize you may need
to think carefully about specifying
`prior_variance`. Whatever the value of standardize, the coefficients (returned from `coef`) are for X on the original input scale.
Any column of X that has zero variance is not standardized, but left as is.}

\item{intercept}{Should intercept be fitted (default=TRUE) or set to zero (FALSE)}

\item{max_iter}{maximum number of iterations to perform}

\item{tol}{convergence tolerance}

\item{Lmax}{the maximum value of L to consider}
}
\details{
Currently runs a 3-stage strategy for each L: first fit susie with very small residual error,
then estimate residual error, then estimate prior variance. If the last step estimates
some prior variances to be 0 then stop. Otherwise double L and repeat.
Initial runs are done with lax tolerance (init_tol); final run done with default tolerance.
