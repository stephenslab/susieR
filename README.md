The `susieR` package implements a simple new way to perform variable
selection in multiple regression ($y=Xb+e$). The methods implemented
here are particularly well-suited to settings where some of the X
variables are highly correlated, and the true effects are highly
sparse (e.g. <20 non-zero effects in the vector $b$).  One example of
this is genetic fine-mapping applications, and this application was a
major motivation for developing these methods. However, the methods
should also be useful more generally.

The methods are based on a new model for sparse multiple regression,
which we call the "Sum of Single Effects" (SuSiE) model.  This model,
which will be described in a manuscript in preparation (Wang et al),
lends itself to a particularly simple and intuitive fitting procedure
-- effectively a Bayesian modification of simple forward selection,
which we call "Iterative Bayesian Step-wise Selection".

The output of the fitting procedure is a number of "Credible Sets"
(CSs), which are each designed to have high probability to contain a
variable with non-zero effect, while at the same time being as small
as possible. You can think of the CSs as being a set of "highly
correlated" variables that are each associated with the response: you
can be confident that one of the variables has a non-zero coefficient,
but they are too correlated to be sure which one.

The package is developed by Gao Wang, Peter Carbonetto, Yuxin Zou,
Kaiqian Zhang, and Matthew Stephens from the
[Stephens Lab](https://stephenslab.uchicago.edu) at the University of
Chicago.

## Quick Start

Install susieR from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=susieR):

```R
install.packages("susieR")
```

Alternatively, install the latest development version of `susieR`
from GitHub:

```R
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stephenslab/susieR")
```

See [here](https://stephenslab.github.io/susieR/articles/mwe.html) for
a brief illustration of `susieR`. For more documentation and examples

## Developer notes


+ The `Makefile` contains various R commands to build and maintain the package. 
For example to build the website via `pkgdown`:

   ```bash
   make pkgdown
   ```

+ When any changes are made to `roxygen2` markup, run
`make document` to update package `NAMESPACE` and documentation
files.


+ To format R codes in the `R` folder,

   ```bash
   for i in `ls R/*.R`; do bash inst/misc/format_r_code.sh $i; done
   ```
